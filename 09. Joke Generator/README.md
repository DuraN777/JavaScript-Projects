# Joke Generetor

## Using Fetch
One of my first times using fetch, I learned a bit more about it and how promises resolve
Tried using both `.then` notation and `async await `to better understand how they work.
In this case an API with jokes is accessed and jokes are fetched, which are then inserted into `innerHTML` and presented on the page. by clicking the button a random joke is fetched each time.
