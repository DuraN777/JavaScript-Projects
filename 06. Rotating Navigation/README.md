# Rotating Navigation

This Mini project has a lot more CSS than JavaScript. Playing with the layout and positioning a page with hidden navigation is made.
Navigation comes into view by applying a bit of JS to the DOM: NAV becomes visible when 'hamburger' is clicked and hidden again when 'X' is clicked.
The caveat here being that NAV become visible by rotating the page and transitioning Nav elements to be visible.
A little bit of animation is done on the buttons used for showing and hiding NAV elements.
