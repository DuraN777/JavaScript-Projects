# Scroll Animation

Yet another light practice of JS DOM manipulation and animation.
Content is divided in boxes, which are offset to the right and left
on the page via `transform: translateX(400%)`. As viewer scrolls down, new content will become visible by adding a class to boxex that resets translateX to 0.
